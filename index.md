# <a name="description">Description</a>

For the Fall 2024 semester, we hold a weekly practice every
**Wednesday from 7:30-9:00pm** in MC Reynolds 315. Anyone with programming
experience (i.e. if you have taken CSCI 150 or its equivalent) is
welcome!

The Hendrix programming team typically competes in the
[ICPC](https://icpc.global/) (in the [Mid-Central USA
region](https://icpc.global/regionals/finder/Mid-Central-USA-2024))
each year.  In the past we also competed in the [CCSC Mid-South
programming
contest](http://www.ccsc-ms.org/index.php?page=contest&sub=info); as
of 2024, we also host our own annual programming contest, the
[HCPC](https://hendrix-cs.github.io/hcpc/).  In these contests, teams
of three compete to solve as many programming challenges as possible
within a fixed time limit.

## Resources for beginners

Just getting started with competitive programming?

* For help with the basics, see [the help pages on Open
  Kattis](https://support.kattis.com/support/home).
* See the Newcomer's Guide (Chapter 1) and reference templates
  (Section 2.1 and 3.1) in our [team reference document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hendrix-CS/programming-team/master/reference/Hendrix-comprog-reference.pdf).
* Solve lots of problems on [Open Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/).
  Start with the easiest ones you can find, and occasionally try a
  problem that's a bit harder for you.  Your goal at first should be
  to solve many problems, not necessarily to work on difficult ones.

## Intermediate resources

Once you've solved a bunch of easy problems on Open Kattis and are
ready to level up, you can start trying to work through our team
reference document and/or the CP4 book:

* [Competitive Programming 4](https://cpbook.net/)
* [Team reference document](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hendrix-CS/programming-team/master/reference/Hendrix-comprog-reference.pdf)

Use the [Methods To Solve page](https://cpbook.net/methodstosolve) to
find appropriate Kattis problems to help you practice topics from the
CP4 book.  Our team reference document also lists appropriate Kattis
problems for practicing each topic.

## Advanced/miscellaneous resources
